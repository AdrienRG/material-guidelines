## Pickers
1. Pickers provide a simple way to select a single value from a pre-determined set.
2. On mobile, pickers are best suited for display in a confirmation dialog. For inline display, such as on a form, consider using compact controls such as segmented dropdown buttons. Using these components in your app helps ensure that a user's specific date or time input is formatted correctly.
3. The format of a date picker adjusts automatically to the locale, i.e. month-day-year in the U.S. and day-month-year in other regions.
4. The format of a time picker adjusts to a user’s preferred time setting, i.e. the 12-hour or 24-hour format.
