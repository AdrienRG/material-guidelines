## Selection controls

Selection controls allow the user to select options. There are three kinds: checkboxes, radio buttons, and on/off switches. Selection controls use the theme’s accent color.

### Checkbox
1. Checkboxes allow the user to select multiple options from a set.
2. If you have multiple options appearing in a list, you can preserve space by using checkboxes instead of on/off switches.
3. If you have a single option, avoid using a checkbox and use an on/off switch instead.

  3. Disabled: #FFFFFF, Opacity  30%
  
### Radio button
1. Radio buttons allow the user to select one option from a set. Use radio buttons for exclusive selection if you think that the user needs to see all available options side-by-side.
2. Otherwise, consider a dropdown, which uses less space than displaying all options.

  2. Off: #FFFFFF, Opacity  70%
  3. Disabled: #FFFFFF, Opacity  30%

### Switch
1. On/off switches toggle the state of a single settings option. The option that the switch controls, as well as the state it’s in, should be made clear from the corresponding inline label. Switches take on the same visual properties of the radio button.
2. The on/off slide toggle with the text “on” and “off” included within the asset is deprecated. Use the switch shown here instead.

5. Use the outer radial reaction only on form factors that favor finger touch, where interaction may obstruct the element completely. For desktop usage with a mouse, you do not need this extra indication.
