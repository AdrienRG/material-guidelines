## Toolbars

### Usage
1. Toolbars appear a step above the sheet of paper affected by their actions. When sheets scroll underneath toolbars, they are clipped and cannot pass through to the opposite side.
2. Sheets can also cover the toolbar as they move offscreen.
3. Finally, the second sheet can cover the toolbar as it moves.
4. A toolbarâ€™s left and right actions are never split by another sheet of material, with the exception of temporary materials such as menus or dialogs.
5. Instead, toolbars can constrain their width to make space for sheets of paper passing over them. The actions on the left and right cluster to stay on the same side of a toolbar.
6. Toolbars can share a seam with another sheet.
7. In cases where they share a seam that transforms into a step, it is called a waterfall.
