## Text fields
1. Text fields allow the user to input text. They can be single-line, with or without scrolling, or multi-line, and can have an icon. Touching a text field places the cursor and automatically displays the keyboard. In addition to typing, text fields allow for a variety of other tasks, such as text selection (cut, copy, paste) and data lookup via auto-completion. See Patterns > Selection for text selection design.
2. The type of text field determines what kind of characters are allowed inside the field and may prompt the virtual keyboard to optimize its layout for frequently used characters. Common types for which you should optimize include numbers, text, email address, phone number, personâ€™s name, username, URL, street address, credit card number, PIN, and search query.
