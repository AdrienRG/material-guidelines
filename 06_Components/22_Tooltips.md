## Tooltips
1. Tooltips are labels that appear on hover and focus when the user hovers over an element with the cursor, focuses on an element using a keyboard (usually through the tab key), or upon touch (without releasing) in a touch UI. They contain textual identification for the element in question. They may also contain brief helper text regarding the function of the element. The label itself cannot receive input focus.

### Usage
1. Use tooltips for interactive imagery.
2. Tooltips don’t display rich information including images and formatted text.
3. Tooltips are different than ALT-attributes, which are intended primarily for static images.
4. Tooltips don’t have directional arrows; instead, they rely on motion emanating from the source to convey direction.
