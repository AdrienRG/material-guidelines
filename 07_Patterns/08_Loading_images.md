### Loading images
1. Illustrations and photographs may load and transition in three phases at staggered durations, rather than relying on opacity shifts. Combine opacity, exposure, and saturation changes to suit your needs.
2. Exposure levels are adjusted for low-contrast and desaturated color. Once opacity reaches 100%, the final stage includes full-color saturation.
3. A lower-contrast effect combines a shift in gamma and black output for darker images.
4. Progressive fade-in
  1. Visualize the image fading in, like a print during the photo development process.
  2. Donâ€™t adjust the levels in a way that will overexpose the lighter values.
5. Duration
  1. A longer duration is recommended for loading images, and a shorter duration is recommended for transitions.
6. Larger screens
  1. This process is ideal for larger screens, such as loading the Chrome OS wallpaper.
7. Adding animation
  1. Add a small position shift to loading images. The background image shown here in the account switcher animates in horizontally.
