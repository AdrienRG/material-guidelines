## App structure
1. Your app's structure should be influenced by the content and tasks you want to show your users. For example, your app could:
  1. Focus on a single activity (such as a calculator or game)
  2. Contain limited navigation (such as a phone dialer with contacts)
  3. Contain complex data views and deep navigation (such as a mail app with folders)
  
### Start screen
1. The start screen is the first screen people will see when launching your app, and it should benefit both new and regular visitors. Structure the experience according to what typical users will want to do.
  1. Put content forward. Make content the centerpiece of your start screen. Use visually engaging and responsive layouts.
  2. Anchor navigation and actions. Consider the app bar for presenting navigation controls, including tab switching and search.
  3. Focus on functionality. Highlight important navigation destinations and de-emphasize infrequent ones. Use the floating action button to promote a primary action.

### Top-level navigation strategies
1. Top-level navigation introduces your app’s major functions. Match the navigation to the complexity, or simplicity, of your views.
2. A single view with embedded navigation
  1. Apps with simple structures can embed navigation within app content. However, doing so reduces the space available to display content.
  2. Recommended for:
    1. Apps with a strong primary view, and few alternates
    2. Completing common tasks
    3. Infrequent usage
  3. Tabs
    1. Tabs switch between a small number of equally important views. They can increase awareness of top-level views for apps with few functions or shallow hierarchies. Tabs take up significant space on smaller displays, so short labels are encouraged.
    2. Recommended for:
      1. Frequent view switching
      2. Limited number of top-level views
      3. Promoting awareness of alternate views
  4. Mobile
    1. For apps with a single level of navigation, text-based tabs can be used across the top.
    2. Three to four horizontal tabs are the recommended maximum, using short strings, to avoid scrolling on smaller devices.
  5. Tablet and desktop
    1. Screen size, orientation, and the number of sections determine if tabs should be:
      1. Full-bleed or fixed
      2. Aligned left, center, or right
3. Side navigation and navigation drawers
  1. To display many navigation targets at once, use side navigation. It can appear either with or without a navigation drawer. A drawer can be an efficient way to switch contexts from lower-level screens, and it remains hidden until invoked by the user. Apps with a single “home” should list the most frequently accessed destinations at the top of the navigation drawer.
  2. Recommended for:
    1. Apps with a large number of top-level views
    2. Quick navigation between unrelated views
    3. Deep navigation structures
    4. Reducing visibility of infrequent destinations
  3. Mobile and tablet
    1. The navigation drawer is closed by default and temporarily opens until a section is selected.
  4. Desktop
    1. The navigation can appear directly on the page rather than in a drawer.

### Combining navigation strategies
1. In-context navigation
  1. In-context navigation allows nimble movement between related sets of data when used with tabs or navigation drawers.
  2. Use it to:
    1. Link a song to an artist
    2. Move between recent items and a complete history
    3. Connect a user’s post to their profile page
  3. The up arrow is used to return to the previous level.
2. Side nav and tab combinations
  1. Products with two levels of navigation may pair a left navigation drawer with tabs.
