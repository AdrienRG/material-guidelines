## Navigation

### One level
1. Tabs
  1. Products with a single level of navigation may use text-based tabs across the top.
  2. To avoid scrolling, use a maximum of three to four horizontal tabs.
  3. On tablet, tab width and alignment are determined by factors such as screen size, orientation, and the number of sections. Tabs can be either full bleed or fixed along the left, center, or right.
  4. See Tabs for more information.
2. Navigation drawer
  1. The navigation drawer may be used for navigation. It is closed by default and opens temporarily until a section is selected.
  2. See UI Regions and Guidance for more information on top-level navigation strategies.

### Two levels
1. Navigation drawer + tabs
  1. If your product has two levels of navigation, pair the left navigation drawer with tabs.
  2. On mobile and tablet, the navigation drawer supports only a single level of navigation.
2. Navigation drawer
  1. On desktop, a secondary level of navigation may be nested within the navigation drawer.

### Three levels or more
1. Navigation in content
  1. If your product has multiple levels of navigation, the navigation drawer should contain the primary level of navigation.
  2. Mobile and tablet
    1. Sequential navigation levels can be integrated into the content and link to individual pages. The up arrow is used to return to the previous level.
2. Nested navigation drawer + tabs (Desktop)
  1. If your product has three levels of navigation, use both a nested navigation drawer and tabs.
3. Expanding navigation drawer (Desktop)
  1. If your product has more than three levels of navigation, you may use an expandable hierarchy within the navigation drawer. Upon selection, a level collapses to reveal the next level of navigation below. Clicking on a collapsed section expands that level in-line within the drawer and hides all levels outside of the current selection.
4. Cascading navigation drawer (Desktop)
  1. If your product has more than three levels of navigation, you may use cascading menus to expand navigation drawer content horizontally. Each level is presented in its own panel, and a level closes when a subsection is selected.
