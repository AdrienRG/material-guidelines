## Color
Color in material design is inspired by bold hues juxtaposed with muted environments, deep shadows, and bright highlights. Material takes cues from contemporary architecture, road signs, pavement marking tape, and athletic courts. Color should be unexpected and vibrant.

### Color palette
1. This color palette comprises primary and accent colors that can be used for illustration or to develop your brand colors. They’ve been designed to work harmoniously with each other.
2. The color palette starts with primary colors and fills in the spectrum to create a complete and usable palette for Android, Web, and iOS. Google suggests using the 500 colors as the primary colors in your app and the other colors as accents colors.

### UI color application
1. Choose your palette
  1. Limit your selection of colors by choosing three hues from the primary palette and one accent color from the secondary palette.
2. Use opacity for text, icons, and dividers: You can change the opacity of text to convey how important certain information is relative to other text.
  1. Dark text on light backgrounds
    1. For dark text on a light background, the most important text has an opacity of 87%. Secondary text, which is lower in the visual hierarchy, has an opacity of 54%. Text hints, like those in text fields and labels, and disabled text have even lower visual prominence with an opacity of 26%.
  4. White text on dark backgrounds
    1. The chart values relay relative levels of importance for white text on dark backgrounds.
  5. Hint and disabled content
    1. Hint and disabled text and icons have an opacity of 26% for dark text on light backgrounds, and an opacity of 30% for white text on dark backgrounds.
  6. Text on colored backgrounds
    1. For white or black text on colored backgrounds, see these tables of color palettes for the appropriate contrast ratios and hex values.
  7. Other elements
3. Toolbars and status bars
  1. Toolbars and larger color blocks should use the 500 color of the primary color of your app. The status bar should be the darker 700 tint of your primary color.
  2. Bold use of color in large fields is encouraged. Different elements in the UI can take on different parts of your color theme.
4. Accent color
  1. Use the accent color for your primary action button and components like switches or sliders.
5. Fallback accent colors
  1. If your accent color is too light or dark to sufficiently contrast with the background color, use a darker or lighter tint of the accent color instead. If your accent color doesn’t work at all, use the 500 version of your primary color on white backgrounds. If your background color is the 500 version of your primary color, make your accent color either white 100% or black 54%.

### Themes
1. Themes let you apply a consistent tone to an app. The theme specifies the darkness of the surfaces, level of shadow, and appropriate opacity of ink elements. To promote greater consistency between apps, light and dark themes are available to choose from.
