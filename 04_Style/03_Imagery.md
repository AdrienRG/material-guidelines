## Imagery
1. Imagery is more than decoration. It’s a powerful tool to help you communicate and differentiate your product. Bold, graphic, and intentional imagery helps to engage the user.
2. Whether the mood is subdued and muted or bright and colorful, the following principles and best practices can help you successfully incorporate imagery and bring your apps to life, no matter what the visual brand.

### Principles
1. When using illustration and photography to enhance the user experience, choose images that express personal relevance, information, and delight.
2. Appreciate context
  1. Ensure images are dynamic and context-relevant. Use predictive visuals to substantially improve the user experience.
3. Be immersive
  1. When necessary, it’s acceptable to obscure or allude to integrated heros and thumbnails through color and content overlays.
  
### Best practices
1. Use multiple mediums
  1. Both illustration and photography can live within the same product. Photography automatically implies a degree of specificity and should be used to showcase specific entities and stories. Illustration is effective for representing concepts and metaphors where specific photography might be alienating.
2. Stay away from stock
  1. Use imagery to express a distinctive voice and exemplify creative excellence.  
  2. For specific entities or branded content, use specific imagery. For more abstract content, be interpretive. Photographic stock and clipart is neither specific nor interpretive.
3. Have a point of focus
  1. Have an iconic point of focus in your imagery. Focus ranges from a single entity to an overarching composition. Ensure that a clear concept is conveyed to the user in a memorable way.
4. Build narratives
  1. Create an immersive story and a sense of context to humanize your app. Define the mood through visual storytelling. Is the mood aspirational? Somber? Celebratory?

### UI integration
1. Resolution
  1. Make sure your images are appropriately sized for displays and across platforms. Material design emphasizes large images. Ideally, the assets should not appear pixelated. Test appropriate resolution sizes for specific ratios and devices.
2. Introduce scale
  1. Introduce alternative scales to create levels of visual importance.
3. Text protection
  1. To make typography legible on top of imagery, apply text protection in the form of scrims. Scrims are lightweight, translucent material layers.
  2. To avoid banding (the formation of distinct stripe shapes), the gradient should be long, 3x standard app bar height, with the centerpoint about 3/10 towards the darker side of the gradient. This gives the gradient a natural falloff and avoids a sharp edge.
  3. The gradient’s opacity should be chosen based on environment. In this image the dark end is 60% black, but could be as low as 10-20% in some contexts.
4. Avatars and thumbnails
  1. Avatars and thumbnails represent entities or content, either literally through photography or conceptually through illustration. Generally, they are tap targets that lead to a primary view of the entity or content.
  2. Avatars can be used to represent people. For personal avatars, offer personalization options. As users may choose not to personalize an avatar, provide delightful defaults. When used with a specific logo, avatars can also be used to represent brand.
  3. Thumbnails allude to more information—letting the user peek into content—and assist navigation. Thumbnails let you include imagery in tight spaces.
5. Hero images
  1. Hero images are images that are usually anchored in a prominent position, above the fold, such as a banner at the top of the screen. They serve to draw in a user, provide context about the content, or reinforce the brand.
6. Gallery
  1. Gallery images are bold visual hero images within homogenous layouts in either a grid or as a single image.
